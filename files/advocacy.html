		<h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
		<p>This organization first started in Philippine Science High School - Southern Mindanao Campus on September 14, 2022. With the beginning of face-to-face classes, countless social groups, communities, and platforms emerged. While most of it have resulted in positive effects in the students' wellbeing, it is unavoidable that there are also negative consequences. 
			<br><br><br>The guidance visits increased during the first months of classes which was not a good sign. Online communities which now is the most popular way of socializing, is a factor in the student's decline of mental health. Hopefully, there were still no cases of any self-harm however, there is a need of intervention to prevent this in the future. This organization aims to spread awareness not only in SMC but to all other campuses as well. All Pisay communities must cooperate in order to build a healthy and student-friendly online environment for everyone.</p>

		<h1>MEMBERS</h1>
		<p>Members are composed of a diverse group of students in all grade levels from all Pisay campuses committed to improving the ease of access and security of social media communities created by the students. 
			<br><br>While some of CWA's content and tools are available for everyone to enjoy, special members have direct access to exclusive group chats and can help manage the affairs and events held by the organization. Each campus will have at least 1 representative in charge of overseeing the sub-organization of their school which will be selected within each campus.<br><br>Contact us for more information.  </p>
